I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much space

And when you're out there, without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you
Who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinking: I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence, I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

2. Renato Rivera Vives 

Take me out tonight
Where there's music and there's people
And they're young and alive
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one
Anymore
Take me out tonight
Because I want to see people
And I want to see life
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
Because it's not my home, it's their home
And I'm welcome no more
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
Take me out tonight
Take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
And in the darkened underpass
I thought, "Oh God, my chance has come at last"
But then a strange fear gripped me
And I just couldn't ask
Take me out tonight
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
Driving in your car
I never, never want to go home
Because I haven't got one, la-di-dum
Oh, I haven't got one
Oh, oh
And if a double-decker bus
Crashes into us
To die by your side
Is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
Kills the both of us
To die by your side
Well, the pleasure, the privilege is mine
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out
There is a light and it never goes out

3. Gianfranco Romero Sucapuca

If I knew how
I'd tell you all the time
Talking about
And I'd tell you what it's like
Well, holy hell
Might as well talk to myself now

Different how
Our feelings don't align
Solve it and now
It's repeating all the signs
Well, holy hell
Trying not to talk to myself now

You never wanted anything
Well, are we over?
Tell me again
No matter what our hearts will bring
It's over, it's over, I think!
Remember counting all the things
Well, are we over?
Tell me again
No mattеr what our hearts will bring
It's over, it's over

With or without
I'm trying to pick a sidе
Deep in my doubts
I'd be passing twenty-five
Well, holy hell
Trying not to think how it felt now

You never wanted anything
Well, are we over?
Tell me again
No matter what our hearts will bring
It's over, it's over, I think!
Remember counting all the things
Well, are we over?
Tell me again
No matter what our hearts will bring
It's over, it's over, I think!
It's over, it's over, I think!

No matter what our hearts will bring
It's over, it's over

4. Gisella Salmon´s favorite song

Lemon Tree by Alle Farben y Fools Garden

I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast
I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
Sing!
Dap-dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dadada-dadpm-didap-da
Dap-didili-da
I'm sittin' here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out takin' a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired
Put myself into bed
Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
Isolation is not good for me
Isolation, I don't want to sit on the lemon tree
I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
Baby, anyhow I'll get another toy
And everything will happen and you wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
And all that I can see
Is just a yellow lemon tree

5. Luis Felipe Acosta Zavaleta

Unsealed on a porch, a letter sat
Then you said: I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand
I wanna leave it again, yeah

On a weekend
I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called, and I said
That I want what I said
And then I call out again

And the reason oughta'
Leave her calm, I know
I said: I don't know
Whether I'm the boxer or the bag

Ah, yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave

I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know
I don't want to stay
Make me cry

I see, oh, I don't know
Why there's something else
I wanna drum it all away
Oh, I said: I don't
I don't know
Whether I'm the boxer or the bag

Ah yeah, can you see them
Out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave

But I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know
I don't wanna stay at all
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna stay, I don't
